                <h3>Early Life and Education</h3> 
                <p>Mahatma Gandhi was born in Porbandar, Gujarat, India on October 2, 1869. His father was a high-ranking official in the local government, and his mother was a devout Hindu. Gandhi was a mediocre student in his early years, but he eventually studied law in London and became a barrister. During his time in London, he became interested in Indian nationalism and the ideas of nonviolent civil disobedience.</p>

                <h3>Civil Rights Activism in South Africa</h3> 
                <p>In 1893, Gandhi moved to South Africa to work as a lawyer. There, he became involved in the Indian community's struggle for civil rights, and he founded the Natal Indian Congress to fight against discriminatory laws. Gandhi's experiences in South Africa strengthened his belief in nonviolence, and he developed the concept of satyagraha, or passive resistance, which he later used in the Indian independence movement.</p>

He led several campaigns of nonviolent civil disobedience, including the Champaran and Kheda agitations, the Khilafat movement, and the Salt Satyagraha. Gandhi's leadership and philosophy of nonviolence were instrumental in India's eventual independence from British rule in 1947.</p>
